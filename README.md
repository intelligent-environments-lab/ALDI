# The good, the bad, and the ugly: Data-driven load profile discord identification in a large building portfolio

## Project Description:

A project focused on developing a data-driven algorithm for automated load profile discord identification (ALDI) in a large portfolio of buildings. Specifically, ALDI 1) uses the [matrix profile](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html) (MP) method to quantify the similarities of daily subsequences in time series meter data, 2) compares daily MP values with typical-day MP distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and 3) identifies daily load profile discords in a large building portfolio. We evaluate ALDI using the metering data of both an academic campus [UT Austin](https://utilities.utexas.edu/) and a residential neighborhood [Pecan street](https://www.pecanstreet.org/).
